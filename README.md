A [cookiecutter] for the creation of [toil] and [click] Command Line Interfaces (CLI).

    pip install cookiecutter-toil
    cookiecutter cookiecutter-toil


# Features

* üê≥ &nbsp; **Containerized System Calls**

    The `commands.BaseJob` inherits from [`toil_container.ContainerCallJob`][toil_container], a Job class with two abstract methods `check_output` and ``check_call`` that will be executed with either Docker, Singularity or Python's subprocess. See `toil_container` [README][toil_container] to learn more.

    A `Dockerfile` example is included. If you use [singularity], the generated `README` will include information on how to generate a singularity image.

* üì¶ &nbsp; **Pip Installable Project**

    Check the `setup.py` and `setup.json` for pip configurations. The only place where you have to define the **version** of your project is in the [`VERSION`] file. After generated, your project can be installed with:

        # local install
        pip install --editable <your_project_dir>

        # after deployment - check the continuous integration section
        pip install <your_project_name>

    | `.gitignore`         | with well curated python ignore patterns                                      |
    | `.gitmessage`        | with issue types mapped to emojis! Like üöÄ for a new feature, or üêõ for a fix |
    | `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | A [covenant] code of conduct                                                  |


* ‚úÖ &nbsp; **Testing Suite**

    **[Pytest]**: python test examples are included, give them a try with:

        py.test tests

    **[Pylint]**: Google style linting configuration is included with the `.pylintrc`. Additionally, Docstrings conventions are tested with [pydocstyle] and are defined in `.pydocstylerc`.

        # check linting conventions
        pylint --rcfile={your_project_dir}/.pylintrc {your_project}

        # check docstrings
        pydocstyle --config={your_project_dir}/.pydocstylerc {your_project}

    **[Tox]**: Run `pytest`, `pylint`, `pydocstyle` with [coverage] on isolated python environments at the same time:

        tox

* üåÄ &nbsp; **Continuous Integration**

    [Travis CI] configuration with automatic deployment to `PyPi` with tags on `master`. To encrypt your `PyPi` password replace the field `deploy.password` in the `.travis.yml` configuration file and run:

        travis encrypt --add deploy.password

    Check out this [tutorial][travis_deploy] if you want to learn more about deployment.

* üêÅ &nbsp; **Click Mode**

    [Click] is an great package to seamlessly build CLI packages. Use `cli_type="click"` if you want to use the goodies of this cookiecutter but don't need the [toil] rocketry. By using this mode, some of the toil specific modules and tests will be removed.
