A [cookiecutter] for the creation of [toil] and [click] Command Line Interfaces (CLI).

    # Run:
    cookiecutter https://github.com/leukgen/cookiecutter-toil

    # Or for ssh:
    cookiecutter git@github.com:leukgen/cookiecutter-toil.git

# Features

* üê≥ &nbsp; **Containerized System Calls**

    The `commands.BaseJob` inherits from [`toil_container.ContainerCallJob`][toil_container], a Job class with two abstract methods `check_output` and ``check_call`` that will be executed with either Docker, Singularity or Python's subprocess. See `toil_container` [README][toil_container] to learn more.

    A `Dockerfile` example is included. If you use [singularity], the generated `README` will include information on how to generate a singularity image.

* üì¶ &nbsp; **Pip Installable!**

    Check the `setup.py` and `setup.json` for pip configurations. The only place where you have to define the **version** of your project is in the `setup.json` file. After generated, your project can be installed with:

        # local install
        pip install --editable <your_project_dir>

        # after deployment - check the continuous integration section
        pip install <your_project_name>

* üçâ &nbsp; **Python Modules**

    | Module          | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `cli.py`        | Include the function that is mapped to the cli command, see `setup.json:entry_points` |
    | `commands.py`   | Include a [toil] example pipeline                                                     |
    | `exceptions.py` | Include package specific exceptions                                                   |
    | `utils.py`      | Multiple util functions are available                                                 |
    | `validators.py` | Defines common validators                                                             |

* üöß &nbsp; **Contributing Features**

    | File              | Description                                                                    |
    | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `README.md`       | with some example sections.                                                    |
    | `CONTRIBUTING.md` | with full steps on how to properly contribute with your project.               |
    | `.gitignore`      | with well curated python ignore patterns.                                      |
    | `.gitmessage`     | with issue types mapped to emojis! Like üöÄ for a new feature, or üêõ for a fix  |


* ‚úÖ &nbsp; **Testing Suite**

    **Python** Some test examples are included using [pytest], give them a try with:

        py.test tests

    **Linting** Google style linting configuration is included in a [pylint] configuration file `.pylintrc`. Docstrings conventions to be tested with [pydocstyle] and are defined in `.pydocstylerc`.

        # check linting conventions
        pylint --rcfile={your_project_dir}/.pylintrc {your_project}

        # check docstrings
        pydocstyle --config={your_project_dir}/.pydocstylerc {your_project}

    **Full Picture** A [tox] setup is provided to run tests on isolated python environments. The `tox.ini` file enables you to run `pytest`, `pylint`, `pydocstyle` and [coverage]. Tox will also tests the installation procedure. To skip the installation, use `tox --develop` (great for development).

        # run the default tox environments
        tox

        # skip the installation, great for development
        tox --develop

        # run a subset of the environments
        tox -e report,lint

* üåÄ &nbsp; **Continuous Integration**

    [Travis CI] configuration with automatic deployment to `PyPi` with tags on `master`. To encrypt your `PyPi` password replace the field `deploy.password` in the `.travis.yml` configuration file and run:

        travis encrypt --add deploy.password

    Check out this [tutorial][travis_deploy] if you want to learn more about deployment.

* üêÅ &nbsp; **Click Mode**

    [Click] is an great package to seamlessly build CLI packages. Use `cli_type="click"` if you want to use the goodies of this cookiecutter but don't need the [toil] rocketry. By using this mode, some of the toil specific modules and tests will be removed.
